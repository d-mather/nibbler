The purpose of this project is to create my own version of the 2D game Snake, with at least 3 different GUIs. These GUIs being shared libraries.

Controls:
 - Up, Down, Left, Right Arrow keys = Change direction
 - Spacebar = Temporary boost (*If you press the arrow in which direction the snake is already moving, It will also boost)
 - '>' = Increase snake speed manually
 - '<' = Decrease snake speed manually
 - 1, 2, 3 = Change game's colour
 - esc = End Game
